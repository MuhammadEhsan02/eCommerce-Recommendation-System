One such technique is the use of *Recommender systems*, where famously known examples are how Netflix recommends movies or how Amazon recommends products [[3]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.337035).\n",

The algorithm mines for frequencies in the dataset and seeks to establish association rules between items. The algorithm is often used in traditional market basket analysis where it finds rules such as: \"If the customer has put milk in the basket, the the customer is likely to also buy eggs\". This can be used to provide recommendations on Olist based on the customers current basket.\n",

The goal of the algorithm is to provide a widget that can ease the shopping experience, for instance if the customer puts a new phone in their basket, an instant pop-up could say \"Do you want a cover with your phone?\" and then recommend a specific cover. This is an example rule that the algorithm could find if customers that purchases phones also often purchases a cover. This would for the customer be seen as a very natural addition, and the likelihood of the customer following a good rule is generally quite high.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are many points of discussion in this technical report, the most important which will be listed below.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Most customers only use Olist once**\n",
        "\n",
        "As was discovered in the descriptive analysis, most customers only use Olist once. This impacts systems that rely on user-information to make recommendations such as CBF and IICF. This can either be due to a too limited datarange, or simply because Olist has a very special business model. Either way, this is something that must be looked into in order to increase performance of the systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Most customers buy only one product**\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly to customers only using Olist once, the majority of customers only purchase one single product as well. This means that not only are there very sparse customer information, there is also very sparse product information due to the excessive amounts of products on the platform. This further reduces performance of the recommender systems, especially systems such as the ARM, but CBF and IICF systems are also impacted. Using recommender systems can be part of the solution to making people buy more, and might improve on itself when implemented.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Features are too superficial**\n",
        "\n",
        "A big issue especially for the CBF system is that features for the products are very superficial and does not tell much about the product itself. It the product description was available an SVD and NLP model could be used to extract more detailed information about the products which would significantly enhance predictions using CBF.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Reviews are per order not per product**\n",
        "\n",
        "One big issue when using CBF and IICF is that Olist has recommendations not pr. product but pr. order, this means that the reviews may not be directly transferable to the product as has been done in this report. This issue once again shows that the Olist data pose some serious limits on the performance of the systems, why they at most can be considered MVP's (Minimum viable products) or POC's (Proof of concepts).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Systems have not been evaluated using test/training splits**\n",
        "\n",
        "Also traditionally being best practice, test/training splits have not been used to evaluate the systems in this report. This is due to the fact that initial evaluations showed how *random* the systems behaved due to lack of data and sparsity. As such, it was concluded that test/training splits and more traditional evaluation techniques would only lead to wrong conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Systems are quite 'advanced'**\n",
        "\n",
        "The systems proposed here are quite advanced, however, due to the limitations posed by the Olist dataset, Olist might be better off using some very basic and naive recommendations initially, before implementing more advanced systems like these. One such example could be to simply look at the product the user is currently viewing and finding similar products using a very basic similarity construct. I.e. if the user is viewing a Huawai phone, an android and an apple iphone might be listed as recommendations to give the customer more opportunities. This type of recommendation system was, however, not implemented as this is hypothesized to not directly increase products pr. order as it simply suggests alternatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Lack of domain knowledge**\n",
        "\n",
        "The final point of discussion is the lack of domain knowledge available. Olist operates in Brazil and might have a very different culture than what is known here in karachi, additionally, not much knowledge was available for how Olist operates on a general level. As such, any recommendations and analysis herein should preferably be gone over together with domain experts from Olist."
